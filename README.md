color via tag is a plugin that adds an extra tag to the main one, this may be needed to make the base look better. Can
be used to add color or img. 

How does it work(hard to understand by yourself): 
1) Press add row button
2) Write your main tag
3) In the second column enter the property (this can be img or color)
4) Press Confirm

TODO:
1. Automatic color for new note with tag
2. Redesign
3. Color for links
